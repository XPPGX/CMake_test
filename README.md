# VScode_CMake_MinGW
## Introduce
This is a sample project which is according to the posts
[VScode+MinGW+CMake шинч╜о](https://eloquent-semolina-12335f.netlify.app/post/win10-vscode-mingw-cmake/). But in this project, I modify the "CMakeLists.txt" file a little bit and change the structure of this project by adding some files to observe the function of "CMakeLists.txt".

You can use "git clone" or "download as zip" to get this project.

## Notice
After you get this project, the directory named "build" should be empty. Thus We can use CMake command to create some file in there.

Then you can use the Debug or Build Command like below:
1. Debug : In VScode, use "Ctrl + Shift + D" to open Debug, and click the green triangle.
2. Build : In VScode, use "Ctrl + Shift + B" to let VScode Build this project according the "tasks.json" which is already been writen rightly.
